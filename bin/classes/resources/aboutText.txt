	This game is based off the game "Breakout" published by Atari, Inc. The goal is to destroy all the bricks on the field, by returning the ball with the paddle, which is controlled by the mouse. There are two types of bricks: power bricks and tough bricks. Tough bricks have toughness, changing the number of times they need to be hit to destroy. Power bricks have one toughness, and grant a power up comprised of a single letter when destroyed.


	Power bricks have a gold border, and have different colors inside to distinguish power ups:
(Power ups and their effects do not carry between lives or saves)

- WHITE: 'C'lears a row
- RED: 'D'amages all bricks by one
- GREEN: 'L'ife is gained
- YELLOW: 'P'ower is doubled (damage)
- LIGHT BLUE: 'R'acket width is increased
- BLUE: 'S'peed of ball is reduced


To activate the current power up, use the left mouse click.
